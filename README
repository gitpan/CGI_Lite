CGI_Lite v1.9
-------------

You can use this module to decode form and query information, including
file uploads, as well as cookies in a very simple manner; you need not
concern yourself with the actual details behind the decoding process.

Here are the changes for this version:

In order to use CGI_Lite in a persistant application (e.g. using FCGI
or mod_perl), each new request must be parsed afresh - that is, the CGI
object's state needs to be reset for each request. The new function
parse_new_form_data() clears the CGI object's state before calling
parse_form_data().

e.g.

	use FCGI;
        use CGI_Lite;

	$cgi = new CGI_Lite;

	while(FCGI::accept() >= 0)
        {
	    $form = $cgi->parse_new_form_data;

	    print("Content-type: text/html\r\n\r\n");

	    $cgi->print_data;
        }
